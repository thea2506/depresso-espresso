from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
# After you migrate the models to the database, you can register them here to be able to see them in the admin panel and directly manipulate them on the admin site.

# Example
# from .models import Room
# admin.site.register(Room)
# Basically we import the model from the models.py file and then register it to the admin site. Then click refresh, you will see your model there
